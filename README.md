By --> RAGHAV SHARMA

|| This repository is a collection of Python code written over 100 days as I learn and improve my programming skills ||


# Day 1 – Python Basics 🐍

On Day 1, I covered some foundational Python topics through small programs:

### ✅ Scripts I wrote:
1st : Find the remainder using `%`
2nd : String manipulation and length
3rd : Practice with `and`, `or`, `not`
4th : Comparison operators like `==`, `<`, `>`

### 👨‍💻 What I Learned:
- Taking user input with `input()`
- Using `int()` to convert strings to numbers
- Boolean expressions and conditional logic
- Basic string methods: `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `len()`
