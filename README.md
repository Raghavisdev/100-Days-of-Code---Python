# 100-Days-of-Code---Python
Beginner to Advanced 🐍
By --> RAGHAV SHARMA

|| This repository is a collection of Python code written over 100 days as I learn and improve my programming skills ||


# Day 1 – Python Basics 🐍

On Day 1, I covered some foundational Python topics through small programs:

### ✅ Scripts I wrote:
- 1st : Find the remainder using `%`
- 2nd : String manipulation and length
- 3rd : Practice with `and`, `or`, `not`
- 4th : Comparison operators like `==`, `<`, `>`

### 👨‍💻 What I Learned:
- Taking user input with `input()`
- Using `int()` to convert strings to numbers
- Boolean expressions and conditional logic
- Basic string methods: `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `len()`


# 📘 Day 2 - Python Basics: Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries & Mutability

This repo covers:

- ✅ Lists (mutable, ordered)
- ✅ Tuples (immutable, ordered)
- ✅ Dictionaries (mutable, key-value pairs)
- ✅ Concept of mutability vs immutability

## 🔸 Lists
- Ordered, mutable collection of elements.
- Supports modification, appending, removing, sorting, etc.

## 🔸 Tuples
- Ordered, immutable sequence.
- Cannot be changed once created.
- Useful for fixed data or unpacking.

## 🔸 Dictionaries
- Key-value pairs.
- Mutable and very fast for lookups.
- Modern Python (3.7+) maintains insertion order.

## 🔸 Mutable vs Immutable
| Type         | Mutable | Examples              |
|--------------|---------|------------------------|
| List         | Yes ✅   | `[1, 2, 3]`            |
| Tuple        | No ❌    | `(1, 2, 3)`            |
| Dictionary   | Yes ✅   | `{"a": 1, "b": 2}`     |
| Integer, Str | No ❌    | `5`, `"hello"`         |

# 🧠 Day 3 - Python Basics: Conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`), Comparisons & Logic

This repo covers:

- ✅ `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements
- ✅ Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)
- ✅ Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- ✅ Nested conditionals and decision trees


# 🧠 Day 3 - Python Basics: Conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`), Comparisons & Logic

This repo covers:

- ✅ `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements
- ✅ Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)
- ✅ Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- ✅ Nested conditionals and decision trees

## 🔸 `if`, `elif`, `else`
- Used to make decisions in code.
- Checks whether a condition is **True**, and executes a block accordingly.

Operator	           Meaning Example
==	     Equal to	       a == b
!=	   Not equal to	       a != b
>	   Greater than	       a > b
<	    Less than	       a < b
>=	  Greater or equal	   a >= b
<=	   Less or equal	   a <= b

🔸 Logical Operators
Used to combine multiple conditions:

Operator	                             Description Example

and	       True if both are true	     age > 18 and has_ID
or	    True if at least one is true	age > 18 or with_guardian
not	      Inverts the condition	not          is_blocked
